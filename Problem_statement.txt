 We need to implement Constraint satisfaction problem for the following problem:
There are six people that need to sit by a round table for dinner: Alice, Bob, Charlie, Darek, Eliza, and Frank. Alice and Bob want to sit
next to each other. Charlie does not want to sit next to Darek. Eliza wants to sit directly across from Alice. After dinner, Eliza wants
to sit across from Frank instead of Alice.
